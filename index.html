Theoretical Perspective:
Application to Family Ties
Dr. Stephen Lin
Overarching Questions throughout the Course
 What is your definition of family?
 Are there more than one type of family?
 What role does family serve in our lives?
 What is the relationship between family and society?
Myths or Misconception of Family
 Family is in decline
(abandonment of today’s elderly)
 High divorce rates  family dysfunction
 Nuclear family as an ideal family type
 Family members share uniform experiences
 The young and the old live in their own way
Family Ties & Aging: Theoretical Orientations
 Avoiding the functionalist paradigm because...
 Continuity & Change
 Multi-level (macro-meso-micro)
 Multi-faceted (multiple life domains)
 Diversity
 Intersecting structured relations (age, gender, class, ethnicity)

 Individual Agency in context (making choices)
 Negotiated relationships (e.g., caregiving) – ‘working out’ ties
Core components covered by combining
3 theoretical approaches
 Life course
 Cohort
 Feminist
The Life Course Perspective
“The life course perspective links the experiences of later life
to earlier life stages and of old family members to younger
ones.” (Connidis, 2010:15-16)
The Four Ts of the Life Course Perspective
1. Trajectories (e.g., long-term pattern of stability and
change)
2. Transitions (short-term change in one’s status)
3. Turning points (e.g., marriage, childbirth)
4. Time: chronological, social & historical
 (Review their definitions in text)
Other Key Life Course Principles
 Life stage principle
-Impact of life transitions on individuals varies by:
o Timing (when does a specific event occur in one’s life)
o Sequencing (the order of life events)
 Linked lives
 -Connections with others and reciprocal influences of
 interdependent lives.
Life Course Perspective
 Human agency
-individual biographies (through actions and decisions)
 Agency-within-structure (Settersten)
-constraints & opportunities determined by our SSR
 Macro-meso-micro link
Inquiries about Family Ties & Life Course
 How are family lives of older people linked to
other family members?
 Intergenerational bonds (e.g., filial piety)

Weaknesses of the Life Course Perspective
1. Limited theoretical development
 -Must specify theoretical leanings beyond claiming a life
 course perspective
2. Failure to connect structured social relations
 -Linking age, gender, class, race, ethnicity and sexual
 orientation to social institutions and to individual lives
The Cohort Perspective:
 The definition of cohort
-people who occupy a specific age category
 (e.g., 1900s, 1990s, 2000s)
 The significance of cohort
 -sharing a similar historical time that shapes their
 collective life experiences (‘cohort effect’)
-sharing similar ‘social time’
The Cohort Perspective
 Stability
-to the extent that people continue to replicate the
 behaviours of preceding cohorts, dictates the amount of
 change that occurs
 Can you think of things we repeat now that our parents
 also did when they were our age?
 Change
-occurs to the extent that successive cohorts do something
other than merely repeat the patterns of behaviour of their
predecessors
Inter-cohort Differentiation
 Differences between cohorts occupying a particular
stage of life at different time periods
 Sources of differences
-social norms, attitudes, practices, historical time
Feminist Perspective
“The personal
 is political”
Feminist Perspective
 Among first to critique family life and expose structured
social relations (gender) that permeate family life
 Gender & age as power relations
 Intersectionality
Theory Application Paper (20%)
 Think critically of how different
theoretical/conceptual frameworks apply to family
ties and aging over the life course
 The combination of different theories and concepts
 the complexity of family ties
Social Support
Social Support
General Definition
-Help and assistance people give to one another
-covers a wide range of help
Types
♥ Informal support (e.g., family, friends, neighbours)
$ Formal support (e.g., help from those whose job is to
provide help, help from government-subsidized
programs or paid workers)
Characteristics of Formal & Informal Social Support
 Complementary
 Often the combination of both
 One does not necessarily replace the other over the life
course (Why?)
 Changes over the life course (examples?)
 Varies by gender, marital status, ethnicity/culture & socioeconomic status
 Relevance of Social Policies (political economy)
-public issue or private trouble?
Social Support in the Life Course Perspective  Help received by older persons (focus in the textbook)
 Informal & formal support received at all ages
 Some geared toward particular life stages
 The application of linked lives to informal social support
 The importance of social networks
Social Support of Older Persons
 Caregiving as a form of social support
 Conceptual clarity (social support caregiving)
 Distinguish caregiving from social support

 Types
-Emotional, financial, instrumental/tangible support
 Social Network
-size & family composition (siblings’ gender)
The Convoy Model of Social Support
 The ‘time’ factor of social support
 The dynamics of social networks over time
some leave, some stay, some join the convoy
over the life course
different life stages
continuity & change

Aging & Social Support: Main Findings
 Intimacy-at-a-distance
 Most old people are NOT lonely or isolated.
 Informal caregiving from family (mostly) & friends remains
the primary form of care for seniors
 Key Factors that affect the informal caregiving arrangements
 -living arrangements/geographical proximity
 -quality of family ties (harmony vs. conflict)
 -gender (sons/brothers vs. daughters/sisters)
 -economic resources (caregiving does cost money!)
 -cultural norm (e.g., filial piety)
Gender & Social Support
 Men rely more on spouse as confidants and best
friends; women also include children, friends
 Women provide more social support. Why?
 Women provide more hands-on personal care,
homemaking and emotional support; men more
advice, home maintenance and monetary help.
 Women more likely to be primary caregivers, men
secondary caregivers
 Serial caregiving not simultaneous care to two
generations (sandwich generation)
Social Support Providers & Recipients
 Much research focuses on social support from
spouses & children.
 Need more research on cultural minorities,
siblings, grandchildren, distant relatives &
friends
 Less care = inadequate care?
To Sum up….
 The application of LC, cohort, and feminist
perspective
 Multi-level analysis, multi-dimensionality
 Intersectionality (age, gender, class, ethnicity)
 Gender & Social Support
 Variations across different ethnic groups
 Be aware of overgeneralization!!
Family Ties Over the Life Course
Dr. Stephen Lin
Older Persons in a Family Context
“Family ties in old age are the culmination of a lifetime
of decisions made, roads taken and not taken, and
changing times and social worlds.” (Connidis, 2010: 3)
Family context
• Move beyond the nuclear family model. Why?
• Focus on late-life families OR family relationships in later life?
• Continuity & Change (Family Dynamics)
- linked lives (reciprocal impact)
Assessing (or Judging) Family Ties
Micro-level analysis
- Individuals do not necessarily share
uniform experiences of family ties
“Comparisons across time require us to
consider the impact of both continuity
and change from the vantage point of
different family members.”
(Connidis, 2010:10)
Social Support for the Elderly
Be Cautious
• Must avoid the view of ‘blaming the victim’ (William Ryan)
• The balance of meeting challenges of aging and family life as private
trouble versus public issue (C. Wright Mills)
➔ Family or social responsibility or both?
The Availability of Family Ties in Later Life
Family structure (meso-level)
▪Size
- Number of generations (vertical)
- age of childbirth
- Size of each generation (horizontal)
- fertility pattern (number of children)
▪Gender composition
- brothers & sisters
Availability of family ties
• Age-condensed vs. Age-gapped families
• Demographic & Social Trends
▪ Trends in partner formation (age of marriage)
▪ Fertility (timing and # of children)
▪ Mortality (life expectancy)
Be aware….
“Demographics and social trends are at once a critical component of
the social context in which family members negotiate their
relationships and a product of their time. . . . [W]e cannot simply apply
trend data to our current way of doing things and assume that we have
seen a complete picture of what lies ahead. . . . Changes in the
availability of one type of kin are likely to be met by adaptations in the
way that other ones are negotiated.” (Connidis, 2010:26)
**Trend data**
- indicate cohort differences
For example,
if people have fewer children, they
may negotiate supportive ties with
brothers and sisters when they
require care in old age.
Availability of family ties
• Key trends over the past 50 years:
• marriage rates down
• cohabiting rates up
• divorce rates up, down and stabilized
• fertility rates down
• life expectancy up
• age of first marriage and child up (delayed transition)
• extended kin network through remarriage/re-partnering
• increasing number of foreign born due to immigration –
transnational family (family members living in different locations)
Availability of Family Ties: Spouse, Siblings & Children
General Findings
• Most elderly people have intra- and intergenerational ties
• Significant Gender differences in marital status of the elderly
- widowhood rate (higher for women)
• Significant RACE differences in the U.S.
- lower survival rate of African Americans in old age
Keeping in mind that…
• Cross-sectional data (trends in specific periods of time) - static
• Family ties may change over the life course
• Family history
- dynamic (continuity & change)
e.g. marital history vs. marital status
- long-term observation: trajectory
- longitudinal or retrospective study
The Availability of Marital/Intimate Partner
• Marital status
- the ‘single status’ can be misleading!
e.g., single individuals in a committed relationship
• Intersecting marital status & gender
- men vs. women
The Availability of Children
• Being single can no longer stand as a proxy for no children (Connidis,
2010:38) - why?
• The parents of the baby boom (those born between 1946-1964) –
cohort analysis, historical time
→ ‘A large pool of children’
→ Greater chance of more support from adult children in old age
The Availability of Siblings
• Patterns of fertility – number of siblings
• Likelihood of having step and half siblings
(through remarriage)
Living Arrangements
in Later Life
Living Arrangements in Later Life
Link between living arrangements (individual experience) and
1. Macro-level factors/processes of structured social relations
(gender, class, age, ethnicity)
2. Life transitions (family biographies)
Research on Elders’ Living Arrangements
Elements of Inquiries
1. Where (Location)
2. Housing types (house or apartment?)
3. Living alone or with others?
- personal choice or initiation by others
• ‘Aging in place’ most common over time
→ A very small elderly population in institutional care setting
• How do the elderly perceive ‘Aging in Place’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpqavo4hBBk
• Result: Greying of the suburbs
→ urban planning, community inclusion
→ building an age-friendly city https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVeXYWD0UpU
• Age Segregation compounded by gentrification
Aging, Place and Society
Aging in Place
Building an Age-friendly City
Class Discussion
Imagine that you were hired as an
urban planning consultant for the
city of London, what would you
recommend to them to make our
community more age friendly?
Housing Types
• House (whose house?)
• Between houses (seasonal migration- snowbirds)
• Apartment
• From house to apartment? (transition)
Living alone or with others?
• Living alone (survivorship, marital status in old age)
• Living with someone or others
(e.g., spouse, intimate partner, adult children, parents, siblings, friends)
• Important differences in living arrangements based on the combination of:
o marital status
o gender
o Age
o With or without children
o family ties (quality, culture & family history)
Living with others….
• Adult children or grandchildren
• Siblings
• Friends (‘social family’)
Analytical factors
• Quality of family ties- micro
• Cultural norms (e.g., filial piety in Asia) – macro-meso
• Economic reason (next slide)
Intergenerational Cohabitation
• Misconception
• Mutual dependency and exchanges of support
→ whose point of view?
• Economic benefits (money saving)
Multi-generational Living Arrangements in Canada
• Highly associated with ethnicity
• Most likely seen in families of Asian AND Southern Europrean origin
→ a broader trend
→ note the internal differences by family ties, social class, personal
preferences

Intimate Ties in Later Life
Dr. Lin
Defining Intimate Ties
• Giddens’ “pure relationship”
“a situation where a social relation is entered into for its
own sake, for what can be derived by each person from a
sustained association with another; and which is continued
only in so far as it is thought by both parties to deliver
enough satisfactions for each individual to stay within it.
Love and …sexuality…are connected more and more via the
pure relationship.” (Connidis, 2010:53)
Pure Relationship
• The pure relationship is an ideal type, providing an
abstract standard or referent which we compare with
other intimate relationships
•Individuals who want to live together today must
negotiate, define and justify the characteristics of their
relationship on an ongoing basis

Defining Intimate Ties
Are you in an intimate relationship?
What are features of an intimate relationship?
5 relational components (Connidis, 2010, p. 53):
 Commitment
 Deep feelings & expressions of caring
 Thinking about each other; sharing values & goals
 *Physical intimacy (sexuality): pure relationship
 Interdependence
• pure relationships (presence of sexual relations)
• marriage (legally sanctioned; sex assumed)
• other non-marital intimate partnerships
 (non-conventional)
Intimate relationships include:
Intimate relationships in later life
• Marriage, Remarriage
• Range of relationships reflects new ‘sex rules’ that separate sex
from marriage
 - Same-sex & Opposite-sex cohabitation with sexual intimacy
 - Living apart together (LAT) with sexual intimacy
Gender & age affect engagement in particular relationships
• gender & age-based assumptions – structured social relations –
about appropriate intimate relationships.
Intimate Ties
• Incorrectly assume intimate relationships of old are stable,
 stale – not changing, innovative, or new
• Life course perspective: old have experienced social change
 in intimate relationships similar to that of the young
• “The longer we live, the more change is a constant feature of
our lives and a lifetime commitment a much longer reality.”
 (Connidis 2010, p. 55)
- adapting to the new reality for all age cohorts
Intimate Ties
Intimate Ties
• Core question:
How do social arrangements (ways of establishing intimate
ties) help or hinder different types of relationships to
flourish at different points in the life course?
• Relates to structured social relations especially
- age relations, gender relations & sexual orientation
Central feature of family structure
• Structured social relations X family structure
 a wide range of outcomes
 - influenced by structured social relations (e.g., gender & class)
•Associated with:
- Living arrangements
- Loneliness
- Psychological & material well-being
- Health
Marital Status
•Marriage confers unique privileges & obligations
•Intersection of gender & marital status
- Reinforces masculinity for older men
- Insures > economic security (women)
- Guards against social isolation (men)
•Health outcomes:
- Married & cohabiting have > health, well-being & longevity
 than unmarried
- Never married (single) have > satisfaction & well-being than
 widowed, divorced, separated
• Loneliness:
- Greater among those who had previous relationships
 (e.g., widowed)
- Desolation (feeling forsaken and lonely) vs Isolation (being
 on one’s own); Duration
• Marital Quality
- poor marriages do not enhance well-being
• Married people receive more informal social support, less
formal support, & less likely to live in institutional settings
Marital Status cont’d
• Need a life course approach to marital status: “current
marital status… masks major life course differences among
older persons of the same status.” (p. 58)
- Married once vs. 3 times
- Divorced after 1 long marriage vs. 3 short marriages
• Life course approach to marital history & timing considers
- Sequencing/ ordering
- Transitions
- Duration
• Ageism apparent
- older persons considered asexual or ‘gross’ if sexually active
• Structured social relation of sexual orientation
- unequal access to marry among gay, lesbian adults among today’s
 old in some countries
- LGBT relationships = example of forging relationships without
 marriage &, for old, without children (separating sex from
 procreation/marriage)
• Structured social relation of age
- For old, sex does not = procreation

Sexuality
Sexuality
•New ‘sex rules’ support other than marriage & raise
questions about monogamy (sex outside the
marriage)
• This is NOT a new concern. . .

Sexuality
• Key reason for focus on female monogamy historically:
certainty about paternity
  who is the father?
•DNA testing for various reasons reveals myth of female
monogamy
• Evidence of sexual activity & ‘progressive’ views from
earlier research on younger adults (today’s old)
Shortcomings of limited research on
sexuality in old age:
- Measures used to assess significance of sex (intercourse) -
 What about quality & other sexual activities ?
- Cross-sectional – compared with other age groups – rather than
 over time (cohort & life course perspective)

Sexuality
• Older persons value sexual intimacy as part of a good
relationship
• Majority of those 45+ have regular sex - once a week or
more if 45-59; once a month or more if 75+
• Several gaps among older persons:
- Partner gap; fewer for women & with age
- Gender and age gaps; women & old-old consider sex less
 important for quality of life
- Generation gap re. what is appropriate sexual activity.
Sexuality
•After 50, multiple reasons for good sex life
- more free time
- no fear of pregnancy
- no children at home
- extended view of sexual activity
•But. . . access to a partner can be difficult, especially
for women (fewer men available in the same age
cohort).

Sex, Life and Intimacy in Later Life
Intimate Partnerships
Dr. Lin
• Focus: Long-term unions
= Marriage for most old persons
• Also consider gay/lesbian ties & other relationships
•Hallmark of intimate partnerships:
 Interdependence
•Interdependence varies in:
 Extent
 Balance (between partners) – over the LC
 Shared vs. conflicting interests
 -Individual vs. joint action
Intimate Partnerships
Interdependence is a Hallmark of Long-term Partnerships:
Extent, Balance, Shared/Conflicting Interest, Individual/
Joint Activity
• Factors that alter level of interdependence ?
• Life events, transitions

Marriage in Later Life North of 60: The Marriage Lifers
G&M Jan. 3, 2004 F1
Long-term Unions
• Greater longevity  greater chance of ‘marriage lifers’
 (long-term marriages).
• Likely for the younger generation? No. Why?
o > age at marriage
o > divorce
o > cohabitation
= fewer ‘marriage lifers’ (couples married 50+ years)
The Nature of Long-Term Unions
Long-term “marriages are in motion” Dynamic; ongoing
negotiation in response to changing times and situations
  ‘doing marriage’: life course perspective
Structured social relations played out in marriage
Gender relations:
• ♀ and ♂ satisfied with marriage but ♂ more so
• Health benefits for both but > for ♂
• ♂ rely on spouse as a confidant
• ♀ benefit more from the economic security
The Life Course of Marriage
• Key trouble spots:
 - Different values & lack of mutual interests
• Need multi-level analysis of impact of (good) marriage on
 individual (usual focus), community, & society
• Other concerns: financial security and sexual fulfillment in
 later life
• Good long-term unions involve change, mutual support of
 independence & interests
Good vs. Poor Marriage
Marital Satisfaction Across the Life Course
• Marital satisfaction & happiness  mental health
• A poor marriage (strain, conflict) has negative effects
• Traditional approach to studying marital satisfaction over time:
 1. Focus on family life cycle (e.g., when was the 1st
 child born)
 Problem?
  Ignores childless
 2. Rely on cross-sectional data. Problem?
  Can’t observe change over time
Marital Satisfaction: the LC Perspective
Family life cycle
• Trajectories
 - the impact of multiple key transitions
 (e.g., childbirth, children leaving home)
• Turning points
Marital Satisfaction: the Cohort Perspective
Cohort effects (Glenn, 1998)
 - observations of change in marital satisfaction are
 actually a function of cohort effects
 - differences among cohorts in marital stability
 and quality rather than differences over time in
 the course of all marriage
Cohort and life course comparison
‘On balance, older couples appear to be more satisfied
with their marriages than their middle-aged and younger
counterparts, but they were not happier with their
marriages than they were younger (Umberson et al., 2005)
General Finding on Marital Satisfaction
• Marital satisfaction follows a curvilinear pattern over time
(retrospective approach – thinking back)
• Marital satisfaction is stable over the middle and later years
 Different Inquiry methods  different social realities
• Critical Lenses
- Need more longitudinal research
- Challenge: losing cases to divorce (attrition)
- Tendency to justify behaviour (benefits of staying married)
 Sexuality in Long-term Marriages
 A Typical Old Couple?
Sexuality in Long-Term Marriages
• Sexual activity important but need not be intercourse
• Based more on friendship-based love than on erotic love
• Sexuality in later-life marriage involves the ongoing
negotiation of intersecting age and gender relations.
• Age & gender-related views on what is sexually
appealing and appropriate (intersectionality; macro-micro)
Sexuality and Aging
• Central Question:
How do people sustain their sexual activity over time?
Medicalization of Sexuality
Negative stereotype of aging exemplified by
emphasis on youth characteristic of promotions
for medications designed to sustain sexual
activity (just like in youth)
. . . started with drugs for Erectile Dysfunction . . .

More recent campaigns for ED drugs
 focus on couples . . .

But . . .
exercise of agency by husbands enhanced by use of
drugs such as Viagra
. . . at expense of choice by their wives
 (traditional gender power relations)
 -male dominance vs. female submissiveness
More recent focus of drug companies:
 Women . . .

Sexuality and Marriage
 Long-term couples (gay & straight) find alternatives
to intercourse for expressing satisfying intimacy (a
true advantage of aging in a long-term relationship)
Gay & Lesbian Partnerships
• Significance of historical time
 (life course perspective)
• Canada’s same-sex marriage
 was legalized in 2005
• US’s same-sex marriage was
 legalized in June 2015.
Gay &Lesbian Partnerships
•Intersection of age relations and sexual orientation =
Double invisibility, jeopardy
 “Being old & being gay” (double negatives)
•Many of today’s old gay and lesbian individuals stayed
in closet or came out after life as straight
 → issue of disclosure (to whom, when)
•Growing number of older, long-term couples who are
out publicly in Canada . . .

 Similar to long-term heterosexual partnerships,
household gendered division of labour must be
negotiated
Gay & Lesbian Long-term Relationships
• Parallel factors contribute to rewarding relationship
• Have social support networks (including fictive kin: gay/lesbian
friends)
• Unions less stable than straight marriage
- lack of officially sanctioned unions (recent change)
- and corresponding support
• Gay/lesbian couples in civil unions have closer ties with family
 members than couples who are not (U.S. research)
  Suggests that legal marriage will enhance social support.
Gay & Lesbian Long-term Relationships
• Generally, gay partners more autonomous, egalitarian, & both
in labour force, less monogamous than straight partners
• Ambivalence (namely, contradiction) created by
- working out gender in gay/lesbian relationships
- being in committed relationship that could/cannot be
 legally sanctioned (in some other countries)
• Need more research on married/long-term gay/lesbian
couples (less researched)
Review of Intimate
Ties in Later Life
Dr. Lin
Intimate relationships
 Element of ‘pure relationship’ (involving negotiation)
 Features
 Commitment
 Deep feelings & expressions of caring
 Thinking about each other
 Sharing values & goals
 Interdependence
 **Physical intimacy (sexuality)**
 Changes over the life course
Intimate relationships include
 Pure relationships (the presence of sex)
-security (lasting) vs. personal freedom (ending)
 Marriage (formally defined; sex assumed)
-monogamy (in most countries)
 New Sex Rules (alternatives to marriage)
-LAT, Cohabitation, Open relationship
 Intersection of intimate ties, age, gender & sexual
orientation (meaning??)
Incorrect assumptions of intimate
relationships of old – stable & stale
 Continuity & Changes (LC Perspective)
“Among today’s old people, changes over
time in gender relations, sexuality and
monogamy have set an important context
for the negotiation of intimate relationships
over their life course.” (Connidis, 2010: 55)
Marital Status
 The intersection of structured social
relations (i.e., age, class, gender) with one
another and with family circumstances
creates dynamic variety of outcomes
based on occupying a particular marital
status of individuals
 Multi-level analysis (macro, meso, micro)
Marital Status vs. Marital History
‘Current marital status… masks major life
course differences among older persons of
the same status (Connidis, 2010:58)
 The application of the LC principles
- trajectory, transition, turning point, duration,
 sequencing

Sexuality
 The structured social relations of age relations
 -Young vs. Old
 -Ageism (negative stereotype)
 In connection with sexual orientation
- Heterosexual vs. LGBTQ

Sexuality, Aging & Sexual Orientation
 The decline of intercourse in old age does not
mean the lack of interest in one’s partner
 Sexuality is a far broader concept than
intercourse in all age groups
 The problem of heterosexual intercourse
- excluding LGBTQ’s sexual experiences
The Complexity of Sexuality
 The intersection of aging (LC), age relations
(cohort differences), gender and sexual
orientation
 “Considering intimate relationships among today’s
older persons reveals how aging and age relations
cut across views of gender, sex and monogamy,
illustrating both continuity and change in attitudes
and behaviour.” (Connidis, 2010:61)
Research Bias
 Most research on aging & sexuality is crosssectional (limited view)
 History of sex life in intimate relationships
-continuity and changes

 “A history of active sex life is carried into old age”
Sexual Satisfaction in Old Age
“Other conditions also converge to potentially
enhance sexual satisfaction after 50: more free time,
no fear of pregnancy, no children at home, and
enjoying sex beyond ‘the Act’” (Connidis, 2010:p.63)
 Friendship love more than erotic love
Sexuality in Later-Life Intimate Relationships  Negotiating sexual life in later-life intimate
relationships
 “Sexuality in later-life marriage involves the
 ongoing negotiation of intersecting age and
 gender relations” (Connidis, 2010:71)
  Gender and age-related views on what is
 sexually appealing/appropriate
Long-Term Intimate partnerships
 Interdependence varies by….
 extent
 balance (between partners)
 shared vs. conflicting interests
 individual vs. joint action
 Factors that alter interdependence
- life events, transitions (retirement, declining health)
The Nature of Long-term Unions
 “Marriage are in motion” (ongoing negotiation)
 Marital satisfaction & the family life cycle
 “Looking at marital satisfaction over time
 reflects a life course focus on trajectories that
 takes into account the impact of particular
 transitions, such as having children, on the
 long-term dynamics of a relationship.” (Connidis, 2010: 67)
 Marriage lifer (less common for younger cohorts)
Medicalization of Men & Women
 Sex-enhancing drugs
 The intersection of gender, aging, age
relations and sexuality
LGBTQ Long-term Intimate Partnerships
 Double jeopardy/invisibility
- intersection of age relations and sexual orientation
 Household division of labour
- working out gender and power relations
 Social support for LGBTQ individuals e.g., coming out
 Ambivalence (committed, but not legally sanctioned)
The Impact of Life
Transitions on
Intimate Ties
The Impact of Life Transitions on Intimate Ties
 Retirement
 Declining Health
  Alters interdependence of older spouses & partners
Impact of Retirement
 Retirement = transition into early old age (early 60s)
- social time

 “Hegemonic views of masculinity and femininity that
dominated the life course of today’s old set different
contexts for men and women in retirement.”
(Connidis, 2010:81)
= one reason for research focus on male retiree, female
 homemaker [traditional gendered life course]
Any problem with this hegemonic view?
Individual or Collective Decision?
 Mutual influence (linked lives)
 Who retires first in heterosexual intimate older
couples leads to different outcomes
 Reason that one party retires earlier than the other
(gender comparison)

 Retirement by marital status (married vs. single)
 Synchronized retirement (negotiation required)
Impact: the gendered division of labour
Negotiating the GDL  Marriage Satisfaction
Gendered division of labour continues but sharing of
all responsibilities
 Perception of fairness (subjective negotiation)
 Life course effects on marital quality (continuity of
shared interests vs lack of them pre-retirement) 
Negotiation, better marital quality
Inter-cohort differences
- egalitarian relationships
Egalitarian relationship (pre-retirement)
The Impact of Declining Health
 Alters relationships as interdependence changes
 Essential components of caregiving
 Caring for: looking after someone’s needs
 Caring about: emotional attachment and concern
for someone
 Women more likely to care for spouse in old age
 When heterosexual partner becomes ill:
increased dependency of care receiver
increased dependency of care provider
 Providing care to spouse can 
 > interdependence, closeness (P)
 > burden and health strain for care provider
(especially for women and if partner suffers
from dementia) (N)
  Ambivalence (mixed feelings)
 Caregiving among same-sex couples:
 Seeking care may force disclosure for older gay and
lesbian individuals (or isolation)
 Discrimination for both care provider & recipient
 Individual responsibility for caregiving of a family
member may be heightened in a same-sex relationship
in later life
 HIV/Aids → earlier life stage of caring (off time
caregiver); now evolving into long-term chronic illness
 Isolation from other family members → community
approach to caring among family-like friends (fictive kin)
 Gay and lesbian relationships provide
examples of pure relationships developed
outside of the dominant heterosexual
marriage
 Next topic: Relationship alternatives and
single life
 Questions?
Transitions in Intimate
Relationships in Later Life
Dr. Lin
Why should we study this topic?
 Relationship Dynamics (e.g., social network) over
the life course
 Stability & change over time?
 Personal well-being
 Vulnerable population? Welfare Policy Implication?

Main Focus
 Focus on transitions encouraged by the Life Course
Perspective
 Losses and gains (personal needs, identity)
 Life course principles of timing (on or off time) and
life stage affect personal negotiation of transitions
 Structured social relations played out in personal
negotiation of transitions in intimate ties
Multi-level Analysis
 Relationships are constantly negotiated across the
life course as individuals exercise agency within their
structural constraints (macro-meso-micro link)
  Diverse experiences
Key Transitions
 Loss:
Widowhood/ Death of Long-term straight or
same-sex partner
 Divorce/Dissolution of Long-term straight or
same-sex relationship
 Gain:
 Remarriage / Repartnering
 Cohabitation
 Living Apart Together
 Dating or Steady Companions
Widowhood / Loss of Long-term Partner
 Current research focus: Widowhood and Women
 Why?
 Know less about impact of losing ‘unofficial’
long-term partner, especially gay or lesbian
partner
 Research bias/gap
Widowhood / Loss of Long-term Partner  Timing and life stage
 Among gay couples, AIDS may lead to early loss of partner
(“off time” - early life stage)
 In comparison with many widows/widowers in later life
(“on time” – old age)
 “Different experiences of transitions in intimate partnership”
Impact of spousal/partner loss
 Living arrangements (e.g., nursing home)
 Changes in support network
 Financial challenges
- especially for heterosexual low SES women
 Personal adjustment (household division of labour)
Widowhood / loss of partner
 Widowhood as event (losing a a spouse) and as
process (going through bereavement and
transitioning to a new status)
 Bereavement
= grief after the initial loss of a spouse.
 Period of intense personal feelings managed over
time → incorporating dead spouse into current life
 Usually lasts for 2-4 years (highly variable)
Widowhood/loss of partner cont’d
 Whether death sudden or after long illness,
similar process of bereavement appears to
occur
Narrative on Bereavement
Bereavement
After sudden heart attack & death of husband,
John Gregory Dunne, in their home, she wrote:
Life changes fast.
 Life changes in the instant.
 You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.
 The question of self-pity. . . .
 For a long time I wrote nothing else.
 Life changes in the instant.
 The ordinary instant.
Joan Didion. 2005. The Year of Magical Thinking. NY: Knopf, p.3.
Joan Didion
Experience of being widowed:
feeling vulnerable & invisible
(isolation) (pp. 74-75)
Bereavement
 Impact of unexpected sudden death
  lack of anticipatory socialization (turning point)
  challenge of entering a new status
 Costs of long-term caring (physical strain, social
isolation)
 Different ages and duration of the long-term intimate
ties have varying consequences for adjustment .
Widowhood Effect
Major Findings (Harvard School of Public
Health, 2013)
 Over the 10 years studied, widows and
widowers had a 66% increased chance of
dying within the first three months after a
spouse’s death
 When income and wealth were taken into
account, there was no difference between
widows’ and widowers’ chance of dying
Possible explanations
 The physical toll of caregiving on the
surviving spouse
 Surviving spouses failing to care for
themselves during widowhood
 A lack of social support
Gendered caregiving before widowhood
 Gendered marital relationships
 Caring for spouse teaches men homemaking
skills traditionally performed by women
 Caring for spouse teaches women ‘physical’
skills’ traditionally performed by men
 Helps transition
Transition to Widowhood
 Defining widowhood as transformation rather than recovery
 Gendered effects of losing a spouse (learning new skills).
-for the current elderly
 As gender relations change, effect of gender on losing
spouse also changes (life course analysis)
 Focus is on today’s middle-aged and older persons
(inter-cohort comparison)
 Current marital status (widow/widower) masks variations in
how long widowhood has been negotiated. (v.s. marital
history)
Widowhood & Family Ties
 More interaction with adult children
(gender difference: F > M)
 More interaction with siblings
 greater emotional closeness, improved ties,
 more frequent & supportive contact
  the convoy model of social support
The Death of a Same-Sex Partner
 The lack of social & legal recognition
 - in many countries: limited formal support
  financial difficulties
 Death at younger ages due to AIDS
 Survivor guilt expressed by widowed
homosexual persons

Survivor Guilt
 A deep feeling of guilt experienced by those who
have survived some catastrophe that took the
lives of many others.
Intersection of widowhood, gender
and sexual orientation
 Negotiation of gender identity after spousal loss
also applies
 More egalitarian relationships among same-sex
couples (Does not apply to all)
 “Unique advantages”
Experiences of Widowhood Among Today’s Old

 For women, < $
 > likelihood of moving
 For men, < social network
 For men, challenge to learn daily homemaking skills
 > reliance on children, especially men & working class
 > involvement with siblings
 - especially women with sisters
 > reliance on friends (women have more)
The Death of Other Long-term Partners
 Other long-term partnership have been ignored
- cohabiting partner, same-sex unmarried partner, other
 long-term commitments
 Limited research indicates common human
experience of losing a long-term intimate partner,
married or not
 Shift from “we” to “I” creates ambivalence as we seek
to remember partner and forget painful experience of
losing that partner
Divorce
 A process, NOT a discrete event
 Stages (marital breakup & adjustment process)
 Changes in status (Life transition)
 Ex: women (homemaker to a paid worker)
Divorce
 Unlike widowhood, divorce usually occurs earlier in life
course (life stage)
 Divorce rates have stabilized
 < marriage & > cohabitation in younger cohorts 
decrease divorce rates & increase chances of other
forms of relationship dissolution
 Older persons have marital histories that may have
one or more divorces (current marital status hides
full count)
Impact of Divorce - Vulnerability
 The financial impact (greater for women in general)
-single mothers (childcare & working) – greater health risk
 The financial hit for men with a lower SES
 Eroding the support network
 social isolation (higher for men)
The Dissolution of Other Long-term Unions
 Fewer barriers to breaking up
 Some unions – such as same-sex partners until
recently – not protected by law (protections of
divorce such as child custody)
 Former gay and lesbian partners more likely to
become friends (renegotiated relationship)
 Need more research on dissolution of long-term
unions other than marriage.
Remarriage
 An important life transition marker (e.g., following
divorce or widowhood at younger ages)
 Remarriage rates down since 1970s
 The intersection of structured social relations, life
stages and remarriage
 - age
 - gender
 - social class
 - marital history (life course)
Remarriage (General Trends)
 Age
- More likely among younger than older
 Gender
- More desired and likely among men than women
 Social Class
 Marital History
 - More likely among divorced than widowed.
 - More desired among those with previous marriages that
 were ‘moderate’ rather than poor
 Why are Remarriage Rates Low in Later Life?
 Linked lives
 Concern for children’s welfare/estate
 Limited options (partner gap, especially for women)
 Fewer incentives (e.g. shorter future)
 Gender
 Women value independence
 Men aware of their poor health = Liability
 What makes Remarriage in Old Age Successful?
 Adult children’s support
 Greater gender balance
 Decline in remarriage offset by cohabitation
Cohabitation
 An arrangement where two people are not married live
together in an emotionally and or sexually intimate
relationship on a long-term or permanent basis
 About 4% of U.S. persons aged 50+ cohabiting (thus
far more common among young)
 A normative practice (e.g., Québec)
Cohabitation
 AGE creates different context for cohabiting
 Cohabit for own sake and to protect children
 GENDER
 Men more likely to cohabit
 Gender equality enhances staying together
 SOCIAL CLASS
 Cohabiting provides financial advantages.
Living Apart Together
 LAT relationships = separate households + longterm, publicly committed, intimate relationship
(sexually active)
 Pure relationship (mutual satisfaction)
 Negotiating the boundaries and understandings of
the intimate relationship
  Possibly turn into cohabitation or marriage later
Choice, circumstance or both?
Intersection of LAT & Structured Social Relations
 AGE
 Especially popular among older couples and those with
previous long-term unions -(intersection of age & life stage)
 GENDER
 Older women like independence, less obligation to be
caregivers in LAT relationships
 LINKED LIVES
 Protect children’s interests, inheritance (self-interest)
LAT Relationships in Canada
Living Apart Together, Martin Turcotte, 2013.Ottawa: Statistics Canada. March.
7% of Canadians in a LAT couple but significant age differences:
 20-24 25-29 30-59 60+
% LAT 31 17 3-5% 2% but growing
Will Live Together 80% of young LAT couples 30%
Duration 2.3 yrs (20-29) 3.8 yrs (40-49) 7.5 years
Circumstance or choice? 42% vs 39% overall
Choice 31% 66%
Circumstance:
 Studies 26% (especially if < 30)
 Financial 25% ( especially if < 30)
 Work 15% overall; 32% of 40-49
Choice
 Independence 4% 15% (40-49) 37% (46% ♀; 30% ♂)
Dating & Steady Companions
Middle-aged and old
growing market for
dating services.
Dating & Steady Companions
 AGE = different context for dating
 → decline in old age
 > Focus on companionship (not finding mate)
 GENDER
 Men more likely to date
 Study of online dating (n = 18): Men more likely to
 seek committed relationship (McWilliams & Barrett, 2014)
 Men & women from long-term unions find dating hard
 Steady companion (platonic relationship with opposite sex)
enjoyed by some (no commitment yet)
Sexual Intimacy Among the Unattached Old
 Aim for balance between negative (old as sexless)
and positive (old must maintain looks and sexual
performance of youth) stereotypes
 ‘Out-of-wedlock’ sexual activity not new to all old
people (especially men) but may have been long
time ago
 Partner gap for women + gendered views of
appropriate behaviour → < sexual activity among
women
 Clear exception: Jane Juska

Conclusion
 Challenges of losing a long-term partner for older
persons
 PERSONAL TROUBLE AND PUBLIC ISSUE
 Once alone, majority of older persons are inclined
to stay that way, especially women
 Better outlets for intimate relationships and sexual
intimacy now available (not restricted to marriage)
 Some may favour entering platonic companionate
relationships (steady relationships; not everyone is
a Jane Juska).
Being Single in Later LifeChoice or Circumstance?
Dr. Lin
Defining Single Status

Are you single?
 On what basis do you define yourself as single (or not)?
 Looking (way) ahead, do you expect to remain single?
 Does life as lifetime single person seem like an
 appealing option? If so, why?
Defining Singlehood
 Distinguish between unmarried and never married
 Definitional ambiguity
(1) Single as a civil status:
 - individuals who are not in marriage/common-law,
 but may be in an intimate relationship
 (2) Single as a social status:
 - individuals who are not in any intimate relationship
Who is a Single Person?
Common research focus = civil status as NOT married.
Single often used as a catch-all category for all who are
not married.
E.g., a poll of “single women” by American Association
of Retired Persons includes separated, divorced,
widowed, and never married.
The remarkable internal differences of life experiences
in the ‘Single’ categories (e.g., life transitions)
Being Single Stigmatized?
 Cultural ideology that favours marriage (Why?)
 Benefits associated with marriage
 Negative stereotypes
 - lower in self-esteem
 - lower in life satisfaction
 - less agreeable
 - less physically attractive
 - less socially skilled
 -more lonely
 Discussion Question:
 To what extent are these stereotypes true?
Singlism
Refers to stigma, prejudice & discrimination
of/against single in culture favouring marriage
Any Positive Aspects for Singlehood?
Singlehood: Factors & Types
• Being single may be a function of both choice and
circumstance (macro, meso, micro)
• Marriage Squeeze (sex ratio, social trend)
 - a demographic imbalance in which the number
 of potential brides or grooms does not approximately
 equal the number of grooms or brides, causing some
 people to be squeezed out of the marriage market
 - linked to structured social relations (e.g., gender)

Marriage Squeeze in China
• ‘Surplus men’ (Jiang, Feldman & Li, 2014)
• Stringent fertility policy (‘One-Child Policy)
• Infanticide (son-preference childbirth practice)
 imbalanced sex ratio (more boys than girls)
• Women’s improved socio-economic status (changing
 attitudes toward marriage)

Media Coverage
China’s biggest problem? Too many men
due to the widespread abortion of female fetuses
www.cnn.com/2012/11/14/opinion/china-challengesone-child-brooks/

Voluntary vs. Involuntary
 Making choices or facing life constraints?

 “Thus the dimension of voluntary versus involuntary
 singlehood is probably best conceived of as two
 continua rather than a dichotomy, reflecting varying
 degrees of both circumstance and choice in staying
single” (Connidis, 2010:99)
Temporary vs. Permanent (main focus)
The Fluidity of Marital Status
 Dynamic (life course history) rather than static
 “The ambiguity of single status leads some to treat being
single and being married as part of a continuum in which
one may move from one state to another, reflecting the
new reality that being single does not necessarily mean
having no romantic involvements and being married does
not guarantee remaining so” (Connidis, 2010:95)
Various Interpretations of singlehood
Re-conceptualize Singlehood
• Intimate relationships are NOT exclusive for married
couples
• A wide range of variations (living arrangements,
being alone or in romantic relationships)
• With or without children
Research Challenges:
Discussion Time:
 Challenge: How to interpret research when definition
 of single is inclusive?
 What is your view?
Sociological Analysis of Singlehood
• Social changes  demographic shifts (e.g., high singlehood
rates for women in some developed countries: Taiwan,
South Korea, Japan)
• The intersection of structured social relations & singlehood
(e.g., class, race/ethnicity and age)
• The intersection of sexual orientation and singlehood
• The LC principle: historical time, inter-cohort differences
(intersection of historical time and one’s decision to be
single) – a macro & micro link
Gendered Perception of Singlehood
• Being single favours men more than women (why?)
- social construction of gender relations
• Assigning new meaning to singlehood – human agency
• ‘Leftover women’ in China (parallel to ‘surplus men’)
 -1 in 5 women (25-29) unmarried
 - women marry up; ‘harder’ to find a husband
 - social/family pressure (social stigma)
 http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21320560
Single Men assumed to be desirable
(Bachelor By choice +);
Single Women assumed to be odd
(Spinster; Unwanted & lonely -)
Perception of Singlehood in Old Age
Gender, Marriage & Work
• Older married women vs. older single women
• Traditional gendered life course vs. alternative
(social change – inter-cohort differences)
• Different gendered life course patterns
• Shifting gender relations  challenge the
assessment of being single among women
Lives of Older Single Persons
• ‘Socially single’ men & women are more likely
than married persons to rely on paid help
  a marker of independence
Friends often take the place of family and
provide enduring, trusting and supportive ties in
later life (fictive kin) for ‘socially single’ people
Negotiating One’s Life as Single Persons in Old Age
• Negotiating different life domains (family ties, friendship, career) -
human agency factor!!
• Intimate involvements of single persons
• Maintaining active ties with relatives as well as friends (fictive-kin)
• Few are isolated!!
Transition from temporary to
permanent singlehood (less studied!)
• Staying single is not typically treated as a life transition
 no ceremonial or legal marker of being permanently
 single
• Indicators of transition to singlehood (life-long single)
 - passing certain marriageable age: differences
 for men and women
- family obligations (e.g., elder care)
Gay & Lesbian Singles in Mid & Later Life
• Hard to know numbers: unknown numbers in closet
• Age x gender x sexual orientation → isolation of old gays
(especially; youth culture) and lesbians
• Fewer people → difficulty of finding a partner
• Old gay men more likely not to have a partner & to live
alone than old straight men & than lesbians (isolation)
To Sum up….
Pay attention to cohort differences (who stays single and why?)
Changing contexts of being single (may have partners, children)
Impact of structured social relations in experience of being
single (e.g., age, gender, class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation)
Countering stereotypes: older singles can have meaningful lives
(through negotiation of ties)
Single life negotiated over a lifetime.
Back to the beginning: What is a single person? Answer affects
how research results should be interpreted.

Exploring Intergenerational
Relations: Theoretical
Framework
Dr. Lin
What are Intergenerational Relationships
 The relationship dynamics between parents and
children or grandparents and grandchildren
 Key unit of analysis in studies of family ties and
aging (suggesting linked lives)
Review
Components of a sound theoretical framework:
 Continuity and Change
 Multi-level (macro-meso-micro)
 Multi-faceted (life domains)
 Diversity & Inequality (intersecting
structured social relations)
 Individual Agency in context
 Negotiated relationships
Core components covered by combining three key
theoretical approaches:
 Life course
 Life stage and linked lives = core life course
principles related to family ties
 Critical
 Theory & practice (advocacy)
 Micro level of individual lives (agency), meso level of
social institutions & macro level of social structure
(inequality).
 Relationships negotiated across the life course
 Social action can reproduce status quo or produce
change
 Feminist
Perspectives on Intergenerational Relations
1. Solidarity perspective:
 Focuses on strength of intergenerational bonds
 Assumes an ideal family life characterized by
solidarity (strong unity)
 Conflict is minimal and only examined at the
interpersonal level but not socially structured
 implicit focus on individual adaptation (role
 conflict), not social change. (micro)
2. Conflict Perspective
 Emphasis on problems & interpersonal conflict
(e.g., caregiving burden, abuse, neglect of older
parents)
 Vantage point usually from the adult child
 Micro-level not social structural level
What’s missing?
 Solidarity perspective:
 descriptive, static view of family life, implicitly
 assumes status quo (little dynamics)
 Conflict perspective:
 focuses on interpersonal relations with older
people that are problematic
 Need a concept that incorporates core
components of both theoretical perspectives
 Basis for developing a concept of . . .
Ambivalence
Working out Contradictory Forces
Bridging concept (mule = donkey & horse)
Unpacking the complexity of Ambivalence…
“The study of intergenerational relations [and other
family relationships] must . . . address how social
structural forces create contradictions and conflicts
that are made manifest in the social interactions of
family life and must be worked out in family
members’ encounters with one another (Connidis,
2010:140).
 “Sociological Ambivalence”
How to work out sociological ambivalence?
Ambivalence
 Applies at psychological/individual (micro) and
sociological/social (macro & meso) levels
 Contradictions in family relationships and social life
 Co-existence of solidarity and conflict due to
structured social forces
 Sociological ambivalence links contradictions,
conflicts & inequality of social structure (macro) to
social institutions (meso) and to relationships with
family members (micro)
 Reciprocal links between internal family dynamics
and structured social world in which they occur
Ambivalence
 Working out/reduce ambivalence (exercise agency) in
family relations
 Ongoing contradictions of social life make negotiation an
ongoing feature of family ties (dynamic).
 Outcome of negotiations may be harmony, conflict,
estrangement, ambivalence . . . at a particular point in
time (continuity & change).
 Negotiating ambivalence may support current ways of
doing family or create new ways (change).
 Ambivalence brings together core ideas of main
theoretical perspectives in attention to
 contradictions of relationships that are negotiated by
individuals attempting to exercise agency Micro
 in the context of social institutions (e.g., family, work)
Meso
 in the context of variable opportunities and constraints
based on combination of social statuses (structured
social relations) Macro
Consider how theoretical ideas apply to what you learn
about various family ties.
Example: Doctoral Thesis (Lin, 2013)
 Case Study on the Recruitment of Foreign Migrant
Domestic Care Workers in Taiwan
 Macro: family/gender norms (structured social relations) Meso: work-family conflict (social institutions)
 Micro: contradictions (role strain)
 ‘Outsourcing family elder care through the hiring of a
 migrant worker’ (exercise agency)

Intergenerational Ties of Older Gay and Lesbian Persons
 Coming out = ambivalent situation for old
 Younger gay/lesbian couples may use artificial insemination,
adoption . . . to become ‘parents’ together
(socially constructed ambivalent parenthood)
 Socially ambivalent situation of same-sex couples who cannot
marry legally (true for old)
 Old gay/lesbian parents usually have children from straight
marriage
 Reverberating ambivalence as family members decide whether
to ‘come out’ about their parents/grandparents
Intergenerational Ties of Older Gay & Lesbian Persons
Majority of middle-aged older gay men & lesbians (50+) are out to
 their family of origin, to siblings more than to parents (ethnicity)
In U.S. baby boom LGBT sample
Majority have close ties to family of origin
Two-thirds of British sample of gay men & women 50+ consider ties
 with family of origin important
Intergenerational Ties of Older Gay & Lesbian Persons
 Significant variations, e.g., based on race:
“I didn’t come out to my sisters and mother as a Latino gay man
until after my father died 15 years ago. As I expected, they were
very understanding and accepting. I was, after all, the overachieving first born and the major success story of our
dysfunctional working-class Chicano family. . . . My . . . success
insulated me from the hostility faced by most gay men who come
out in communities of color.”
(Almaguer, 2005, p. 17; emphasis added)
 E.g., based on the intersection of class & race:
2012 study of mostly white, well-off LGBT adults aged 48 to 85
years, nearly two-thirds report that their family of origin is
extremely or very accepting of their life as an LGBT person.
(Croghan, Moone, & Olson, 2014)
Parent-Child Ties (US, Canada)
Contact with adult children
 Most seniors have 1 child nearby and see at least 1
regularly
 Geographical proximity associated with
 Propensity of older parents to move nearer adult
children if help needed
 ambivalent feelings of desire and fear
 requires re-negotiating relationships
 Should study multiple points of view (parents &
children)
Nature of parent-child ties in later life
 Older parents serve cohesive function
 Common themes of parenting in old age:
 Dreams for children
 Value independence
 Parenting not central to identity
 More “hands-off” approach to parenting
“be there, should the children need me” (supporting role,
avoiding intervention)
 Children as confidants (reciprocal ties)
-seeking and giving advice
 Tensions & conflicts negotiated over time
 Desire to resolve problematic relationships in family
 Variability in ties with children/children-in-law
 Favour some children over others
 May have positive ties with some children and
ambivalent or poor ties with others
 Recent work proposes ambivalence embedded in
the family structure
 exists when parents feel differently about their
 children and children-in-law
 working out various relationships over time
Support Exchanges
Between Older Parents
and Their Children
Dr. Lin
4 models of social support
Hierarchicalcompensatory
 Hierarchy of favoured
relationships
 Spouse
 Children
 If preferred missing,
replacement from the
lower ranks occurs
 Those without
spouse/children (bias)
Task Specificity
 Focuses on tasks and their
features, NOT particular
relationships
 Introduces need for
diversity in network
Models of Social Support cont’d
 Hierarchical-Compensatory and Task
Specificity:
Fixed view of relationships and social support
networks
Based on normative assumptions
H.C. focuses on nuclear family, excluding
those without spouse/children
Structural-functionalist perspective
Models of Social Support cont’d
Functional Specificity
 Particular relationships can
be negotiated in different
ways
 (e.g. sister helpful for
some but not for others)
 A relationship may serve
many functions
 Particular functions NOT tied
to particular relationships
 Diversity
 Negotiation
Convoy (Antonucci)
 Supportive network of ties
based on support
exchange
 Changes as needs change
or membership change
 Different ties may be
significant at different
times (e.g. sibs) in life
course
 Continuity and Change
 Dynamic
 Putting functional specificity and convoy models
together:
Social support networks
 are negotiated over time
 respond to shifting exchanges/needs and
membership
Same relationship may be negotiated
 in different ways
 by different people
 at different times
Janet Finch (1989)
 To understand social support in families must
combine influence of
culture (macro)
social structure (macro)
family history (life course)
individual preferences (micro)
 The intersection perspective
Legitimate Excuses (Finch, 1989)
 Family division of care work
 Socially acceptable reasons for avoiding
obligations to family members
 Typically seen in adult children who have
good relationships with their siblings
 Family ties and negotiation of ‘fairness’
Adult Children Support to Older Parents
 Most care provided by family
 Support does not necessarily = care
 Research problems
Variable samples
Variable definitions of ‘need’ (context)
Cross-sectional studies vs. longitudinal
Focus on primary caregiver vs. others
Gender bias (focus on support by women)
Pathways to Caring by Adult Children
 Gender difference: daughters > sons
 (exception: son-only families or daughters living far away)
 Employment difference: unemployed > employed
 Combined (G & E): employed women > employed men
 (helpers not primary caregivers)
 Care by more than one person / large family network
(norm), but note the exception (single, unmarried)
Pathways to Caring by Adult Children
 Strong support from adult children who value the norm of
filial responsibility (a person’s sense of duty towards
members of their own family in particular the child-parent
obligation)
 Co-residing adult child (living arrangement)
 Strong support from those with emotionally close bonds
with parents (family history)
 However, previous conflict between the younger and
older generation does NOT necessarily stop their current
support exchanges
Support & family dynamics over the life course
After my parents’ divorce, my aunt raised us. We weren’t close
to her when we were young, but as we got older, we realized
that she was always concerned about us even though she could
be hard to get along with… She would lose her temper easily
and make everything a big deal, so I didn’t have a happy
childhood. After we grew up, we moved out, but I realized that
she might feel lonely, so I’d come home quite often and keep her
company. When she needed anything, I bought it for her. My
brothers also came home during the holidays. Now she is
paralyzed, and we feel obligated to care for her. Since she got
sick, we all moved back here. It’d be easier to take care of her
when we have more people around. (Miss Feng, 36 years old)
Key points
 Gender comparison
 Employment status
 Marital status
 Types of care (intense vs. non-intense)
 Geographical proximity
 The interplay of gender, marital status and work
conditions
Caring cont’d
 Children become carers:
 ‘De facto’ (no one else available as a fact)
 Following family meetings
-someone emerges as a primary caregiver, others
 as secondary caregivers
 Shared care responsibilities among siblings
(relatively equal division)
 Chosen by parents (personal preference)
-gender, family history, emotional attachment
 Child volunteers (least frequent)
-may be more common in Asian societies
-Filial Piety (‘Xiao Dao’- Filial Obligation)
 Sandwich caregiving vs. serial caregiving
-life course, intergenerational exchanges of
 support
 Sons as carers
 Men in sons-only families deal directly with parents,
not each other and encourage independence
 Labour force Participation and caring:
 Paid work (full or part-time)  different style of caring
Work-Life Balance (competing demands) –
ambivalence
 Gender differences
Consequences of Caring:
 Parents have less power (a sense of guilt)
 Children often view caring as delayed reciprocity
 Expectation of care from children
 (collectivist)
 v.s.
 Self reliance/independence
 (individualist)
 Cultural differences (Asian vs. Scandinavian)
Conseqs cont’d
 For children, costs offset by meaning assigned
to caring for a loved one (compensation)
 Emotion work of caring often ignored
 Stress, lower well-being most likely
among daughters (caregiving burden)
when parent is cognitively impaired/has
behavioural problems – more so for sons
“…all things being equal, men and women do not
differ substantially in their experience of emotional
strain. But all things are not equal…on balance, the
social construction of gender (macro) in the family and
workplace (meso) creates different caregiving
conditions for men and women (micro as individual
caregivers)…The fact that caring is considered
normative for women does not remove the feeling of
ambivalence that results from meeting this
obligation…” (Connidis, 2010:168)
Parental Support to Adult Children
 Emotional and financial
 $ based on need
 Consider impact of recession
 Support exchanges remain balanced until
parents 70+; drops markedly after 75 (LC and
aging)
 Extensive support if child has
 AIDS
 disabilities
Co-residence of Adult Children & Older
Parents
 More often due to children living with parents
(re-filling the empty nest)
Parents give more
Both generations generally satisfied
 Likelihood of parents living with children greater
when parents 75 (women) or 80 + (men)
works better when parents can contribute
(requires negotiation)
Co-residence of Adult Children & Older
Parents
 Intergenerational exchange (mutual benefits)
 Ambivalence of sharing a home (co-existing
strain & emotional attachment between older
parents and their children)
In sum
 Ample evidence of active intergenerational support
between adult children and older parents
 In our culture, both generations favour independence
 For most of lifetime, parents give more than they
receive; serious health declines tip the balance
 Parents and children responsive to one another’s
needs and help accordingly
 Multi-level analysis on ambivalence
